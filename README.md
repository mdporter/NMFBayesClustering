## Optimal Bayesian Clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Code for some of the illustrations from the paper ``Optimal Bayesian Clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization" by Ketong Wang and Michael D. Porter. 

The `galaxy.R` file is code for generating Figures 6 and 7 in Section 5.2.

The `crabs.R` file is code for generating Figure 8 and Table 4 in Section 5.3.

The `crabs-draws.rds` are the labels from 10,000 MCMC iterations. Used in `crabs.R`.
